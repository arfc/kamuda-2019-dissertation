I would like to first thank my advisor, Dr. Kathryn Huff, for her guidance and support during my graduate studies. I also want to thank my masters advisor, Dr. Clair Sullivan, for inspiring me to begin my graduate studies and reach further. I owe Dr. Jacob Stinnett for his initial research suggestion and discussions that started this work.

I also want to thank my friends and loved ones for their support, coffee breaks, and happy hour conversations that kept me sane.
