\chapter{Uranium Enrichment Regression Results and Discussion}

\section{Problem Description and Training Dataset Overview}

Natural uranium is composed of U238, U235, and U234. 


The software package RadSrc was used to generate the gamma-ray intensities for U235 and U238 templates \cite{Hiller2007}. RadSrc, developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, uses Bateman equations 

We used the F8 tally to calculate the absolute full
energy peak efficiency of each energy bin.

\section{Results from Training all Models}

% Is it necessary to re-run the hyperparameter search, or are the 'simple' models good enough?

Asymptotic models are 


Again, measure asymptotic MSE convergence.
