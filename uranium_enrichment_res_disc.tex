Verifying the enrichment of HEU through passive nondestructive analysis is important for safeguards applications and homeland security tasks. Nondestructive analysis is preferred to preserve forensics evidence and to allow for remote measurements. 

Measuring the enrichment of uranium is made difficult by the fact that it's characteristic gamma-rays are easily shielded. This task is made more difficult for treaty verification by the restriction placed on inspectors. IAEA inspectors face two major restrictions: a limited amount of time to measure data from declared items and the requirement for an information barrier. This means that direct viewing and analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum - necessary for the enrichment meter method - is impossible. 

The traditional method for using NaI detectors to measure uranium enrichment is the enrichment meter method \cite{Reilly1970}. This method exploits the proportionality between the activity of the 186 keV photon and the enrichment of $^{235}$U. This method requires a 

"Generally, low resolution measurements of 'clean' uranium can be made to 1\% precision over nearly the entire range of uranium enrichment. Measurements in both Europe and the Former Soviet Union have observed bias effects of 5-10\% in low-resolution measurements caused by minor isotopes of uranium. This level of bias has been deemed unacceptable, causing some inspectors to resort to more expensive, time-consuming alternatives like mass spectrometry or liquid-nitrogen-cooler high-resolution detectors. As the international safeguards community attempts to inspect more facilities with less resources, these alternatives become highly undesirable. The minor isotopes come from the use of uranium recycled from reactors being used as feed in the enrichment plants. Daughters of $^{232}$U or $^{236}$U include the thorium decay chain which emits a 238.6-keV gamma ray from $^{212}$Pb. This gamma ray falls in the ROI used to estimate the Compton continuum under the 186-keV gamma ray. In addition, the multitude of high-energy gamma rays from the daughters of $^{232}$U change the shape of the Compton continuum that lies under the desired 186-keV peak. Just to make the entire issue more challenging, the level of this interference varies widely among the samples generally offered to the inspector, causing unpredictable, wide variations in the bias effects" \cite{SPRINKLE1997}

Accuracies of +/- 10\% are expected for quick checks of high enriched material while accuracies of +/- 1\% are expected to verify mass spectroscopy measurments \cite{Kull1974}.

\section{Problem Description and Training Dataset Overview}

The gamma-ray signatures from metallic HEU come from the decay of $^{238}$U, $^{235}$U, $^{232}$U, the daughters of these isotopes, and uranium K x-rays. In low-resolution detectors, The primary photopeaks of $^{235}$U signature are at 144 keV, 163 keV, and 186 keV. $^{238}$U daughters produces photopeaks at 92 keV and 1001 keV. The uranium K x-rays at 98 keV are driven by the alpha decay from $^{234}$U \cite{Hofstetter2008}. $^{234}$U naturally occurs in uranium ore and co-enriches with $^{235}$U due to their close atomic mass. Due to a small branching ratio, $^{234}$U has an unresolvable photopeak at 121 keV in HEU spectra measured by NaI(Tl) detectors.

Because the features that are typically used to differentiate HEU from LEU (the 186 keV peak from $^{235}$U and the 1001 keV peak from the $^{238}$U daughter $^{234m}$Pa) are on very different scales, it may be better to scale the input using the $log1p$ instead of $sqrt$. To test this, each model is trained with $log1p-max$ and $sqrt-max$ scaling.

% The software package RadSrc was used to generate the gamma-ray intensities for $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U templates \cite{Hiller2007}. RadSrc, developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, uses Bateman equations to decay samples. We simulate clean uranium  composed of only $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U. 

% We used the F8 tally to calculate the absolute full energy peak efficiency of each energy bin.

% \subsection{Autoencoder Performance - Fine Tuning networks on Urban Source Search Versus Uranium Enrichment Datasets}

% This section will compare performance differences when fine tuning an autoencoder using features found from the urban source search and the uranium enrichment datasets. The task of isotope identification in the urban source search dataset is different from the task of quantifying uranium enrichment in the uranium enrichment dataset. If the features found from the urban source search are useful as pretraining for uranium enrichment, pretrained networks may be distributed to the community.


% networks and as feature extractors for a DNN. To do this, a trained CAE and DAE will be connected to a dense network. These will be trained to either fixing the autoencoder's weights or by fine-tuning them while the network learns.

\section{Results - Rocky Flats Shells}

The reported Rocky Flats shells isotopics are shown in Table \ref{table:rockyflats_isotopics}. Recent work has found estimated that impurities of $^{232}$U, mass fraction 6.0E-9\%, and $^{237}$Np, mass fraction 1.8E-4\%, \cite{RawoolSullivan2012} existed in the shells in 1971 (the year the shells were fabricated).

Other cases need to be added to the training dataset to make this work in practice. Additional examples need to $^{241}$Am, $^{239}$Pu, and $^{237}$Np from recycled uranium.
