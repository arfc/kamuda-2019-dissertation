Verifying the enrichment of HEU through passive nondestructive analysis is an important treaty verification and homeland security task. Measuring the enrichment of uranium is made difficult by the fact that it's characteristic gamma-rays are easily shielded. This task is made more difficult for treaty verification by the restriction placed on inspectors. IAEA inspectors face two major restrictions: a limited amount of time to measure data from declared items and the inability to look at a gamma-ray spectrum from some material.

\section{Problem Description and Training Dataset Overview}

Natural uranium is composed of $^{238}$U, $^{235}$U, and $^{234}$U. 

While $^{238}$U does not have a significant gamma-ray contribution, the $^{234m}$Pa in it's decay chain does. $^{234m}$Pa decay


The software package RadSrc was used to generate the gamma-ray intensities for U235 and U238 templates \cite{Hiller2007}. RadSrc, developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, uses Bateman equations 

We used the F8 tally to calculate the absolute full energy peak efficiency of each energy bin.

\section{Results from Training all Models}

% Is it necessary to re-run the hyperparameter search, or are the 'simple' models good enough?

Asymptotic models are 


Again, measure asymptotic MSE convergence.
